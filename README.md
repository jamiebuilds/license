### Motivation

I build open source software to make the world a better place. To lower
technological barriers for as many people as possible.

However, over the last few years it has come to my attention that my software
is being used for terrible things by corporations who are willing to step on
their fellow humans.

I cannot stomach this, it really hurts to see my software be used by
corporations like this.

So I'm taking my standard license (The MIT License) and I'm adding a clause
which explicitly does not grant the license to a list of entities.

I don't care if this is not "open source", it's the right thing for me to do.
