### Motivation

I build open source software to make the world a cooler place. To help people make cool software.

However, over the last few years it has come to my attention that dumb peeps have been priotitizing dumb stuff over cool software. Fuck em.

I cannot stomach this, it really hurts to see my software be used by
retards like this.

So I'm taking some dumbfck's licens and I'm adding a clause
which explicitly does not grant the license to idiots.

I don't care if this is not "open source", it's the right thing for me to do.
